# Interface NeoPixels (aka Addressable LED Strip) with Bambu Lab Printers
This code runs on an ESP32 and controls the function of a string of addressable LEDS (WS2812B to be precise) to match
the current state of a Bambu Labs 3D printer.

There is a web GUI that allows you to configure the printer details and the colors and behaviors of the LEDs.

This is a beta version, I'll document it more when it hits a releasable version.
